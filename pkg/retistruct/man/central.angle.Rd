central.angle(phi1, lambda1, phi2, lambda2)

\item{phi1}{Latitude of first point}

Central angle

\description{
On a sphere the central angle between two points is defined as the
angle whose vertex is the centre of the sphere and that subtends
the arc formed by the great circle between the points. This
function computes the central angle for two points \eqn{(\phi_1,
\lambda_1)}{(phi1, lambda1)} and \eqn{(\phi_2,\lambda_2)}{(phi2,
lambda2)}.
